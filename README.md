Metadata folder contains the architecture, the database per tenant,

> Architecture multitenant guide:

> - base/ folder: contains all graphql and hasura dependencies necessary for tenants.
> - build/ folder: prepare tenants with all graphql and hasura dependencies. 
> - tenants/ folder: contains all tenant database files, tables, functions, relations, triggers, etc.
> - build-metadata.sh file: prepares the tenants with their dependencies and corresponding configurations.
> - deploy-tenant.sh: deploys to the database with the tenants, their tables and relationships.

### Steps to execute the metadata:

1. Go to the directory called metadata and run the following command:

``` shell
./build-metadata.sh "tenant_name" --admin-secret myadminsecretkey --endpoint "endpoint"
```
2. Verify build folder contains correct tenant data
3. Deploy the tenants running the following command:

  ``` shell
  ./deploy-tenant.sh "tenant_name" --admin-secret myadminsecretkey --endpoint "endpoint"
  ```

* **tenant_name** is the name of the tenant that you will work on

* **endpoint** is the endpoint where you are running the hasura, commonly it's localhost:8080


# Backend Tests

This project uses Karate framework for API testing. The tests are designed to run in a Docker environment.

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-test.yml run --rm --build karate
```

This command will:

1. Build the test container
2. Start PostgreSQL and Hasura containers
3. Run all Karate tests
4. Show test results in the console
5. Generate HTML reports in `target/karate-reports/`

## Test Reports

After running the tests, you can find the HTML reports at:

- Summary: `tests/results/karate-summary.html`
- Detailed: `tests/results/karate-tags.html`

## Development

### Adding New Tests

1. Create new `.feature` files in `tests/karate/features/`
2. Follow the Karate DSL syntax
3. Tests will be automatically picked up when running the test command

### Configuration

- Main config: `tests/karate/src/test/resources/karate-config.js`
- Database config: `docker-compose-test.yml`
- Test environment: `Dockerfile.test`
